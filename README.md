## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  Interperting user needs is easy to do when directly translating them into user stories. A user story is truly just breaking down suggestions about what users would like to have/ how they expect the app to behave. It's really like having a recipe that is then modified to better suit the taste of the recipiant. 

## How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Connecting with the client is the best way forward. Constant communication to meet their needs helps me design the program to solve whatever problems the project aims to solve. As for agile process that I hope to incorporate I'll be happy to use whatever methods the company that hires me is currently using as I think different projects and team sizes/mentalities goes along way in determining which agile processes are best to use.

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
I believe the best team member will be an understanding one. One that understands their weaknesses and strengths and is able to cover those bases by communicating properly with their team mates. A team memeber who understands that commitment to the project also entails looking at the ethics of the project they are apart of as well.
